# Arithmetic Operator
# Addition:       3 + 2
# Subtraction:    3 - 2
# Multiplication: 3 * 2
# Division:       3 / 2 (this give 1.5, for non comma, use floor division)
# Floor division: 3 // 2
# Exponent:       3 ** 2
# Modulus:        3 % 2
num1 = 3
num2 = 4
absolute = abs(num1+num2)
# abs for absolute
round = round(3.65, 1)
#this will shown 3.7

#Comparisons
# Equal:              3 == 2
